## menubar

A compass mixin for making all css menubars.

meubar is just a simple implementation if a mixin using compass to make some markup conventions using lists and anchors into a menubar. You can set a color and the gradient is generated. You set the font-size, height and then you can set an optional border-radius.

The demo has a simple implementation. I added a class to the unordered list element and then chained a color class to put the mixin in (changing the variables to get different color menubars)
